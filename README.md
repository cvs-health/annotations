# Accessibility Annotations
Accessibility annotations help capture design intent that cannot be conveyed through visual design alone. This can help prevent many accessibility issues earlier and create more usable digital experiences.

The CVS Health® Inclusive Design team has created new Figma annotation kits for multiple platforms. In the future, we intend to add some learning materials for those who are new to accessibility.

## Wiki
Visit the [Annotations Wiki](../../wiki) to find documentation on how to get started with thie kit.

This area will be expanded upon over time to provide more education on best practice annotation usage.

## Support
You may submit [issues](../../issues) and [discussions](../../discussions) to this repository, but as these are open source tools, we’re unable to provide direct support.
