# Accessibility Annotations
Accessibility annotations help capture design intent that cannot be conveyed through visual design alone. This can help prevent many accessibility issues earlier and create more usable digital experiences.

The CVS Health® Inclusive Design team has created new Figma annotation kits for multiple platforms. We use this GitHub repository as a home for kit documentation and discussion. In the future, we intend to add some learning materials for those who are new to accessibility.

## Documentation
Visit the [Annotations Wiki](../../wiki) to find documentation on how to get started with our kits.

This area will be expanded upon over time to provide more education on best practice annotation usage.

## Support
As these are open source tools, we’re unable to provide direct support. You may submit any [issues](../../issues) to this repository. 

We have a [roadmap](../../discussions/2) for future updates, and we welcome [discussions](../../discussions) and [feature requests](../../discussions/categories/ideas) as well. 


## Download the kits
Our open-source annotation kits are available on the Figma Community.
